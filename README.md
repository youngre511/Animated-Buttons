# Animated-Buttons

I made these animated previous, next, and autoplay buttons for use with a javascript-driven slideshow, but they have multiple uses. The animation is done with GSAP. Credit to SVG Repo user afnizarnur for the stop-button svg and for providing inspiration for the other elements.

Included in the repository is the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code necessary for the buttons to work, as well as the required stop-button svg.
